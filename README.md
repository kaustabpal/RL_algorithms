# RL_algorithms

Simple implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms on the CartPole-v1 environment.

## Algorithms implemented

1. [DQN (tensorflow implementation)](/DQN/dqn.py)

Implementation of the DQN algorithm using experience replay buffer and a seperate target network in the OpenAI Gym's CartPole-v1 environment. Accompanying blog article about the algorithm and some of the experiments I did with it can be found [here](kaustabpal.github.io/dqn).
